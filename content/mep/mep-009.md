# Remove the masterPublic document type

## Abstract

The `masterPublic` document type is superfluous and should be removed.

## Current status

The `keyCredential` document type currently includes a full copy of the `masterCredential` document type, as the sole contents of the `masterPublic` document type. Open-Transactions currently does not use it for anything.

After loading a Nym, Open-Transactions does a string comparison of the Nym's `masterCredential` to the key credential's `masterPublic` as a check. Actual key credential verification (i.e. whether the master's signature hashes to the master's `S`-key, etc.) is done using the Nym's `masterCredential`, not the `masterPublic`.

## Drawbacks

None.

## Enhancement

* Remove `masterPublic` from opentxs.
* Update documentation.

## Impact

By removing `masterPublic`, you lose the ability to verify the key credential when it is looked at in isolation. However, Open-Transactions does not ever do that.

Note that we are not losing anything in Ricardian Contracts. For example, `registerNym` is still a self-verifiable Ricardian Contract, as it contains both the `masterCredential` and the `keyCredential`.
