# Rename `credentialList` to `credentialIDs`

## Abstract

Rename `credentialList` to `credentialIDs` for the sake of clarity.

## Current status

`credentialList` is a list. Stating that explicitly in the name is counter to
the standard which is to name lists as a plural of what they contain. This
particular data structure contains IDs (what does that mean?). A more proper
name would be `credentialIDs`. Especially when a second structure
called `credentials` is present.

## Enhancement

Rename `credentialList` to `credentialIDs`. Then, the name is more
descriptive.

## Impact

More clarity.
