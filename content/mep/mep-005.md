Title | Use ISO8601 for date and time formatting
Status | Accepted
Created | 2014-11-17

## Abstract

This MEP is about using ISO8601 for date and time formatting instead of UNIX
timestamps everywhere (in contracts, log, messages).
Source: https://github.com/monetas/opentxs-protocol/issues/87

## Current status

Open-Transactions currently uses UNIX timestamps to format time in all
contracts.

## Drawbacks

UNIX timestamps are not human readable, which is a requirement for Ricardian
contracts. Contracts must be readable by a human judge with no technical
knowledge.

## Enhancement

Replace UNIX timestamps with ISO8601: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601
Example ISO8601 Date-Time: **2007-04-05T14:30**

## Impact

No impact in the logic, as the timestamps are only used for humans reviewing a
contract at the moment.

This is hardly more difficult than a search and replace operation.
This needs changes in the C++ client implementation.
