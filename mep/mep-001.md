# Abstract
This Monetas Enhancement Proposal (MEP) briefly describes the format future
MEPs should be submitted in. The goal of having MEPs is to centralize past
decisions and have a structured way of presenting them.

# Current status
Currently there is no place to record conclusions on changes done to the
software. Nor is there a uniform, structured way of doing so.

# Drawbacks
Having no structed way or place to view significant changes has several
drawbacks:
1. There is no efficient way of referring to past conclusions. Leading to
   obvious frustration and confusion.
2. There is no way to know what is currently discussed and what the status
   might be.
3. Not all the context is always present or evident. This could lead to
   misinterpretation.

# Enhancement
This proposal proposes a way of recording made decisions in a central, self
contained and uniform way. There are several elements a MEP must contain. Each
element will be explained here.
Some inspiration what had from
[BIP-0001](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0001.mediawiki).

## Header
This section is a simple table containing meta data about the document. The
keys in the table are:

1. MEP: contains a unique identifier for the MEP. It must be the next available
   integer in the sequence started by this document and must be left padded
   with zeros to three digits total.
2. Title: a descriptive title concisely summarizing the MEP.
3. Status: tells in which state the document is currently in. Possible values
   are 'draft', the document is still being discussed, 'accepted', the proposal
   set forth in the MEP is accepted and should be acted upon and 'rejected',
   the proposal is after due discussion rejected.
4. Created at: the date on which the MEP was first presented.
5. Author: the original proposers of the MEP.

## Abstract
This contains what every abstract contains; a short summary of the document. In
this case the MEP.

## Current status
This describes the current situation. The description should be as clear and
self contained as possible.
Being self contained implies linking to other sources as reference only. Code
snippets or protocol descriptions should be copied to a reasonable extend. The
goal is to make the MEP understandable when read in a submarine.

## Drawbacks
The current status has drawbacks. Where the 'Current status' paragraph
contained nothing more than a description. This section points out what is
wrong with the status quo.

## Enhancement
While the initial paragraphs set the stage, this section contains the actual
proposed solution. This, too, should be clear, self contained and terse. 

## Impact
However nice a proposed enhancement is the cost of effecting the enhancement
should explicitely be considered. This cost can be internal, code needs
refactoring or documentation needs to be revised. The cost can also be
external, backward compatibility could be broken or specifics should be
communicated with the community.

# Impact
The required effort is minimal. There is scant legacy and even less customs.
