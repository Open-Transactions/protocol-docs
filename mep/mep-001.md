# Abstract

This Monetas Enhancement Proposal (MEP) briefly describes the format future
MEPs should be submitted in. The goal of having MEPs is to centralize past
decisions and have a structured way of presenting them.

# Current status

Currently there is no common place to record conclusions on changes done to the
software, nor is there a uniform, structured way of doing so.

# Drawbacks

Having no structured way or place to view significant changes has several
drawbacks:

1. There is no efficient way of referring to past conclusions, leading to
   frustration and confusion.
2. There is no way to know what is currently discussed and what the status
   might be.
3. Not all the context is always present or evident: this could lead to
   misinterpretation.

# Enhancement

This proposal proposes a way of recording made decisions in a central, self
contained and uniform way. Some inspiration was had from
[BIP-0001](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0001.mediawiki).

A MEP must contain several sections:

- **Header** section

  A simple table containing metadata about the document. The keys in the table
  are:

  1. MEP: contains a unique identifier for the MEP. It must be an integer and
     must be left padded with zeros to three digits total.
  2. Title: a descriptive title concisely summarizing the MEP.
  3. Status: tells in which state the document is currently in. Possible values
     are:

     1. 'draft': the document is still being discussed.
     2. 'accepted': the proposal set forth in the MEP is accepted and should be
     acted upon.
     3. 'rejected': the proposal is after due discussion rejected.

  4. Created: the date on which the MEP was first presented.
  5. Author: the original proposers of the MEP.

- **Abstract** section

  This contains what every abstract contains: a short summary of the document,
  in this case the MEP.

- **Current status** section

  This describes the current situation. The description should be as clear and
  self contained as possible.

  Being self contained implies linking to other sources as reference only. Code
  snippets or protocol descriptions should be copied to a reasonable extent.
  The goal is to make the MEP understandable when read in a submarine.

- **Drawbacks** section

  The current status has drawbacks. While the 'Current status' section contains
  nothing more than a description, this section points out what is wrong with
  the status quo.

- **Enhancement** section

  While the previous sections set the stage, this one contains the actual
  proposed solution. This, too, should be clear, self contained and brief.

- **Impact** section

  However nice a proposed enhancement is, the cost of effecting the enhancement
  should explicitly be considered. This cost can be internal: code needs
  refactoring or documentation needs to be revised. The cost can also be
  external: backward compatibility could be broken or specifics should be
  communicated with the community.

# Impact

The required effort is minimal. There is scant legacy and even less customs.
