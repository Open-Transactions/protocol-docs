Title | Use CurveZMQ for encryption and authentication
Status | Draft
Created | 14-11-2014
Author | Otto Allmendinger

# Abstract

This document describes replacing OpenTransactions current transport encryption
with CurveZMQ.

Doing so would reduce the amount of code which needs to be maintained. More
importantly it replaces a home grown crypto solution with an established and
audited solution, thus increasing security.

# Current status

At the moment messages are encrypted prior to transport with a particular
key pair reserved for this purpose. This key pair is static but could
theoretically be revoked.

# Drawbacks

The current situation has several drawbacks.

## In house development

The code has been developed in house and all the problems associated with it.
The code now needs to be maintained, understood and reviewed by us. Etc etc.
There is no resident cryptographer?

# Enhancement

As a solution for said drawbacks CurveZMQ should be used. This has the
advantages that it reduces the code burden. Much of the transport encryption
code can be removed. Also the CurveZMQ code has been studied longer and by more
people.

## Additional benefical features

* perfect forward security
* build in replay attack protection
* free updates
* etc etc

# Impact

The removal of the transport encryption as it currently stands has functionally
no impact. The transport layer is still encrypted. It would entail changing the
client library and the Notary code. Etc etc.
